# Data-Visualization

**Matplotlib** is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is widely used for plotting data and offers great flexibility and control over the appearance of plots. Matplotlib can produce a variety of plots such as line plots, scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, and more. 


**Main Features of Matplotlib**: 

* High-quality 2D and 3D plots.
* Extensive customization options (color, labels, grids, etc.). 
* Integration with other libraries like NumPy, pandas, and more.

**Common Plot Types in Matplotlib:** 
* **Line plots** for continuous data. 
* **Scatter plots** for visualizing the relationship between two numerical variables. 
* **Histograms** for understanding the distribution of data.

**Seaborn** is a Python data visualization library built on top of **Matplotlib**. It is designed to provide a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. Seaborn works seamlessly with pandas data structures and simplifies the process of creating complex visualizations with just a few lines of code. 

**Main Features of Seaborn:**

* Automatic handling of data frames and statistical plotting. 
* Built-in themes for aesthetics and improved readability. 
* Complex plots like violin plots, pair plots, heatmaps, and more, with minimal code

**Plot Types in Seaborn:** 

* **Pair plots** to show pairwise relationships in a dataset. 
* **Box plots** and **violin plots** for visualizing the distribution of data. 
* **Heatmaps** for visualizing the correlation between variables.
